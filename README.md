# Continuous-Integration
Objective of this exercise is to learn continuous build process (CB) and continuous integration (CI). 
You are expected to: 

- Write python program to convert Arabic Numerals to Roman Numerals 
- Integrate Continuous Build Process to check if your software in each development stage passed the build process. 
- Integrate unit test and run the unit test in continuous integration process.

I include pytest in this section and the result is shown on the screenshot.

##Things done  
-Convert Arabic Numerals to Roman Numerals by implementing convertion.py  
-Implement pytest to test program and use multiple test examples convertion_test.py  
-Github action by workflow  workflows
